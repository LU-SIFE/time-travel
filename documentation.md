# Time Travel And Co.

## Mission:
> Time Travel And Co. is a fake time travel company. their objective is to provide the public with an accesible time travel solution, to let them experience parts of history normally not possible.

## Look & Feel:
> Futuristic
> 
> A futuristic feel includes a lot of hard lines, it doesn't actually have to be futuristic, the website just needs to include a lot of technical jargon and elements to feel that way.
>
> The animation in the corner is basically useless, but it makes it feel like _something_ is going on in the background. the future is supposed to seem busy.
>
> The future is also supposed to seem minimalistic in design. There shouldn't be any clutter that is reminiscient of the early stages of the internet. Instead, Time Travel & Co. should reflect the visions people have of the future in it's design.

### Colorscheme:
> Foreground: light purple (#C493FF)

### Content:
> Main landing page / hero
> 
> time travel scheduling / booking
>
> Timeline of historical events in the past and future

> Q&A section about time travel
>
> ~~Recomended / popular times to visit~~ (unfinished)

## Main Landing:
> this page shouldn't have much other than a nav bar and a main logo, maybe with some animations.

## Schedule / booking:
> This page should contain a form where users can submit a request to travel to a point in time. the form doesnt have to be functional.

## timeline of events:
>This section should show popular "vacation spots" for clients throughout time. Diagram?

## Limitations:
> We didn't have much time with this website, so instead of focusing on both content and features, we put almost all of our focus on the more technical side of the website, like the cursor and animations. we made an entire javascript function to handle the placement of lines between moving objects, which we could have otherwise spent on the content of the website. We'll be honest when we say content is lacking, but i feel like we make up for it when it comes to what I call 'useless but cool' elements of our website. I guess this is more of a technical demonstration. I feel like the beauty of this website lies within the technical aspects instead of it's content and layout.
