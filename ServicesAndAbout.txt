TESTIMONIALS:
"The quantum flux regulator is oscillating at a frequency of 52.3 GHz, which is inadvertently synchronizing with the chroniton particles in the vicinity. This resonance is causing a phase variance in the tachyon pulse generator, leading to a temporal distortion field. If we don't recalibrate the triaxial synchrotron soon, the recursive feedback loop in the subspace field matrix could initiate an uncontrolled temporal vortex, potentially trapping us in a causality loop or, worse, causing a rift in the space-time continuum!" -Steve
